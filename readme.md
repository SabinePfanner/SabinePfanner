# Welcome to my page

## Nice to e-meet you!

I'm Sabine, originally coming from Cologne 🤡 but living in Hamburg since 5 years. I've choosen Hamburg as my place to live because I really love sitting at the habour and observing the big container ships ⚓.

My hobbies are:

- dancing 💃
- travelling (France and Paris are my favorite places :heart:)
- baking 🧁

> Do you have a good recipe, I should know and try?
