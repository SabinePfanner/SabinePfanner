# Welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹

## Nice to e-meet you!

I'm Sabine and I've just joined the developer community. Working in the area of digizalization and having led several IT projects, I know want to dive deeper and professionally into coding and web development. 

My skills:

- HTML & CSS basics
- Wordpress
- SCRUM Agile Project Management

> Do you have any tipps & tricks for a beginner?
